# Neutron Diffusion Simulation in 1-D Reactor Core
This project simulates the neutron flux distribution in a 1D nuclear reactor core using the steady-state diffusion equation. The equation is discretized using the finite difference method and solved using NumPy.

## Requirements
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Output
The script plots the neutron flux Ï•(x) across the length of the core.

## Usage
Run the Python script directly in Google Colab or any Python environment.
